        <h1 class="customized_font">Happiness</h1>
        
        <p class="text text_shadow">Someone's told me: "you deserve to be happy". To be happy isn't just a matter of deserving or not deserving it, it's a matter of being able to be happy or not be able to do so.</p>

    <section class="section" id="section2">

        <h1 class="customized_font">Loneliness</h1>

        <p class="text text_shadow">Some people may say that the wrost thing in this life is to be alone; I don't agree with that. To have a bad company on your side may be more terrifying than any (form of) loneliness.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section" id="section3">

        <h1 class="customized_font">Rain</h1>

        <p class="text text_shadow">I like to just stop and watch the rain; it just describes my heart and my soul. Every drop falling from the sky tells what's beyond the reach of my words.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section" id="section4">

        <h1 class="customized_font">Silence</h1>

        <p class="text text_shadow">Sometimes I just want silence. My priceless inner peace depends on it. - That's the only thing I can't live without (peace). To live without it, is as equal as to not be alive.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section" id="section5">

        <h1 class="customized_font">Dreams</h1>

        <p class="text text_shadow">I wonder what of my dreams will become true. That's what people are used to living for: what's not here yet. But, isn't it enough already? Do you ever stop to realise what you already have here, to the reach of your hands (if you can)?</p>
